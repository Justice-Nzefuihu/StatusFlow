Thanks for sharing your commands. Let's go through them one by one, correct the syntax, and explain what's going wrong — especially with the final command causing the error.

---

### 🔢 Here's what you ran:

```bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in private.pem > public.pem
```

---

### 🧨 The problem:

The **third command** is incorrect:

```bash
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in private.pem > public.pem
```

You're trying to read a **certificate** using a file (`private.pem`) that contains a **private key**, not a certificate. That’s why you're seeing this error:

> `ossl_store_handle_load_result:unsupported`

---

### ✅ What You Should Do

Here’s the corrected and proper workflow if you’re just trying to generate a **private/public key pair**:

---

### ✔ Step-by-step:

#### 1. Generate a private RSA key:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
```

*(or use `-des3` if you want to password-protect it:)*

```bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
```

#### 2. Extract the public key:

```bash
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

✔️ This is the correct way to get the public key from a private key.

---

### ⛔️ Don’t use this command in your case:

```bash
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in private.pem
```

Because `x509` expects an X.509 certificate, not a private key.

---

### 🧠 Extra: Want to create a self-signed certificate?

If you're aiming to create a **self-signed certificate** (e.g., for local development):

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -key private.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

Then you *could* extract the public key from that certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in cert.pem
```

### ✅ Summary

| Action                               | Correct Command                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Generate private key                 | `openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048`                |
| Extract public key                   | `openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem` |
| 🔥 **Don’t use** x509 on private key | `openssl x509 -in private.pem ...` → ❌ wrong usage    |
